For this project, I created a survey that is about your favorite hobbies. It consists of 4 pages asking various questions about your contact information and questions about certain hobbies that you may like.

My survey website consists of several best practices that guided me into making the successful survey website. First, I had to take this project step by step. I had to first create the repository and make sure that the logistics were all correct before I started creating my survey. Then I had to next go onto the next step of creating the content and figuring out what all needed to be in the survey. Before I could do this step, I had to make sure that the first step was completed, making it a process where I had to rely on each step before advancing. This is best practices because I had to take this project step by step and make sure that I was doing it in order, relying on myself to complete a step and then being able to go onto the next one after that is done. Once these two steps were complete, I was then confident that my survey was done and that I could push all of my progress to the main branch to fully update everything.
